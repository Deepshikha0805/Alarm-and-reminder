# Alarm-and-reminder
This Python code sets up a reminder with a notification and a sound alarm. 

The code uses the `plyer` library to display desktop notifications and the `time` module to implement a timer. 

When executed, the code prompts the user to input the reminder message and the number of seconds for the timer. It then sets a notification to display that the alarm will go off in the specified number of seconds. After the specified time elapses, the code triggers another notification with the reminder message and plays a beep sound.

This code provides a basic reminder functionality that can be used to set reminders for various purposes.
